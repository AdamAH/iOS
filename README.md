# Popup Style Menu Buttons

The project attached simply shows how to create a Google style (like the Google Inbox App) popup style menu with buttons. All you need to do is download the project and run it to see how it works. 

### Overview

For this example, 3 buttons have been placed on the main view controller. The constraints have been added to support all iPhones resolutions. Using UIView animations, on click of the main button, we shift up the other buttons to position them above the main button. Also, we rotate the main button (which is a + icon) to make it look like an x icon (close).
